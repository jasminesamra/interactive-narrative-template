# interavtive-narrative-template

This project contains everything you need to get started on your first interactive narrative!

## Getting Started

### Setting up Git on your local machine

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git#setting-up-git) to set up Git on your command line, if you aren't already set up with Git.

You can authenticate via HTTPS or SSH. If this is your first time setting up Git, we recommend you authenticate via HTTPS (if you're already set up to authenticate via SSH, that's alright!).

### Installing

1. Open a terminal window. Navigate to, or create, a directory (folder) where you want to keep your coding projects. For example:

```bash
cd           # navigates to your home user directory
mkdir code   # creates a new directory called code in your home user directory
cd code      # navigate into the new `code` directory
```

2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasminesamra/interactive-narrative-template
cd interactive-narrative-template
```

3. Run the setup script [TODO: update this with Windows instructions]

```bash
scripts/setup_mac.sh
```

4. If all goes well, you will see the following message in your terminal. If you see something else, reach out in the Discord for help!

```
ðŸŽ‰ Setup complete! Please restart your terminal window before continuing. ðŸŽ‰
```

5. Check that everything was installed correctly by running tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
